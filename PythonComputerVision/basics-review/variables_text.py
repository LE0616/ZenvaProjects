# Python language Basics Part 1
# Variable Syntax
name = 'Lauren'
# You do not need to define the varible type and can change between types in python

# Variable Types
# Ints
x_pos = 5
# Floats
speed = 2.5
# Booleans
is_game_over = False
# Strings
character_name = 'Lauren'

print(type(x_pos))

# Operations

# assignment: = not

# arithmetic: + = * / % // += -= *= /+ **
# % returns the remainder of a division
# // (floor) drops the remainder of a division
# ** (raise to the power of)
